# Test guide

This project uses 3 layers of automated tests (unit, integration, and end-to-end). 
It is very powerful setup, but at the same time, it can be challenging to choose the appropriate 
level of test for the problem at hand. 
This is the reason why this guide was created. 

The goal of this guide is to provide an overview of used types of tests, describe their pros and cons, and give hints for when to use which.

### Why multiple levels of test?
Because it is much easier and faster to test small units, but when testing small units separately it doesn't ensure that they will work together.
So we want to use a lot of smaller (unit) tests to cover all the details, because running bigger tests to check all the small details would take much longer.
But then we also need several bigger (integration) tests to make sure that the units work well together and we won't end up like

[this](https://giphy.com/gifs/fail-technology-i5RWkVZzVScmY/fullscreen).
The same argument holds true for unit vs. integration tests as well as for integration vs. end-to-end (E2E) tests. 

### Which level should I use for a given feature?
With the previous paragraph in mind, you should use the lowest possible level that covers the whole feature. 
In practice, it might be easier to go from the top to bottom.
Start with e2e tests where needed and then look for what needs integration tests and only in the end the test coverage report will tell you what still needs unit tests.
This way, you should avoid testing the exact same thing on multiple levels.

This section illustrates the problem on the "Send LSK" feature. Feature description: If a user enters a valid address and amount smaller than their balance, then they should be able to send the transaction to Phaeton network.

Test split:
- **Unit test**: If the whole feature is inside one component. E.g. Address validation, because the validity of the entered address depends only on the entered value and a regexp inside the component. 
- **Integration test**: If the feature relies on multiple components or Redux store. E.g. Balance validation, because the validity of the balance depends on the entered value and the account balance in Redux store.
- **E2E test**: If the feature involves multiple pages and/or API calls. E.g. Sending an LSK transaction with valid inputs.

### Where is each level mocking?
All the tests make assumptions about how things work outside of their scope. These assumptions are made by mocking the environment. Each level mocks something else:
- **Unit test** mock called functions and methods.
- **Integration test** mock server API, router, localStorage.
- **E2E test**: use a local devnet node of Phaeton which is a mock of Phaeton Mainnet network.

The problem of these assumptions is that we cannot be 100% sure that the mocks behave exactly as the things they're mocking. If the mock is not accurate, then we can have a passing test and broken feature. Therefore, every feature should have at least one test that doesn't mock.


## Unit tests

### What do they test?
One unit ([component](/PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub/blob/development/src/components),
[util](/PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub/blob/development/src/utils),
[action](/PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub/blob/development/src/actions),
[reducer](/PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub/blob/development/src/store/reducers),
[middleware](/PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub/blob/development/src/store/middlewares), or
[subscriber](/PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub/blob/development/src/store/subscribers)) in isolation.

### What doesn't need unit test?
- **action that contains no logic** - it is an integration point between React and Redux therefore it should be be covered by integration tests, e.g. [accountUpdated action](https://github.com/PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub/blob/8239062584a9573ac8e99bd28d681563b40048b2/src/actions/account.js#L29-L32) 
- **React HOC (higher order component)** - also integration point, e.g. [header HOC](/PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub/blob/development/src/components/header/index.js)
- **Presentational React component with no logic** - should have coverage by being rendered by its parent in its unit test or integration, e.g. [Spinner component](/PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub/blob/development/src/components/spinner/index.js) 

### How are they organized?
Each unit test live in the same folder as the unit that it tests. E.g. tests for [/src/components/login/login.js](/PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub/blob/development/src/components/login/login.js) are in [/src/components/login/login.test.js](/PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub/blob/development/src/components/login/login.test.js).

Configuration is in [karma.conf.js](/PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub/blob/development/karma.conf.js) and [config/webpack.config.test.js](/PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub/blob/development/config/webpack.config.test.js).

### How to run them?
See [relevant sections of README](/PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub#run-unit-tests)

### What tools are used?
- **Assertions** use `expect` syntax of [chai](http://www.chaijs.com/), e.g.:
https://github.com/PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub/blob/80afda8289b75cb70bf345d14d36117fde2bdd90/src/utils/passphrase.test.js#L136
- **Spies, stubs, and mocks** use [sinon](http://sinonjs.org/), e.g.:
https://github.com/PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub/blob/19a2a613fa08a34fe3088b0e40c11c7fa37a645d/src/store/middlewares/savedSettings.test.js#L20
- To test **React components** we use [enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/), e.g.:
https://github.com/PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub/blob/79165170a326a7f98efee098732e55be37d31223/src/components/toolbox/sliderCheckbox/index.test.js#L21
- To **assert on React compopnents** we use [chai-enzyme](https://github.com/producthunt/chai-enzyme) because it gives more descriptive messages when the assertion fails, e.g.: https://github.com/PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub/commit/bc7677c6d5c205449311ac4e18fd3de6fe2b23ff
- To **assert on spies, stubs and mocks** we use [sinon-chai](https://github.com/domenic/sinon-chai), often together with [sinon.match](http://sinonjs.org/releases/v1.17.7/matchers/), e.g.: https://github.com/PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub/blob/c82683df85b2bc3277c697ebacff24463a8fed2c/src/components/register/register.test.js#L64-L67


## Integration tests

### What do they test?
Integration of all components, utils, reducers, and middlewares on one page, e.g. [Login](/PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub/blob/development/test/integration/login.test.js), [Wallet](/PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub/blob/development/test/integration/wallet.test.js), [Delegates](/PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub/blob/development/test/integration/voting.test.js).

### How are they organized?
Integration tests for each page have their own `*.test.js` file in [/test/integration/](/PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub/blob/development/test/integration).

Configuration is common with unit tests.

### How to run them?
They are run together with unit tests.

### What tools are used?
- All that are used for unit tests.
- [mocha-steps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha-steps) to write the tests in a more [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) way.
- Our own **generic step definitions** [/test/utils/genericStepDefinition.js](PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub/blob/bfc94e4f46b4e2393bcc1a0ecd6f1bc85590b6a6/test/utils/genericStepDefinition.js)
- Our own **mount helper** that wraps `enzyme.mount` to avoid some code repetition: [/test/utils/mountHelpers.js](https://github.com/PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub/blob/bfc94e4f46b4e2393bcc1a0ecd6f1bc85590b6a6/test/utils/mountHelpers.js)


## E2E tests

### What do they test?
Full user scenarios in the application as a whole, including the communication with Phaeton Core. 

### How to run them?
See [relevant sections of README](/PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub#run-end-to-end-tests)

### How are they organized?
E2E tests for each major feature have the tests specified in its own `*.feature` in [/test/e2e/](/PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub/blob/development/test/e2e). The test specifications in `*.feature` files use [Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin) language. The implementation of the steps is in [/test/e2e/step_definitions](/PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub/blob/development/test/e2e/step_definitions). If the step is used just in multiple `*.feature` files, then its definition is in [test/e2e/step_definitions/generic.step.js](test/e2e/step_definitions/generic.step.js). The definition for unique steps of `featureName.feature` is in `featurename.step.js`.

Configuration is in [protractor.conf.js](/PhaetonHQ/phaeton-hub/blob/development/protractor.conf.js).

### What tools are used?
- [Cucumber-js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) for Given-When-Then Scenarios and Behaviour-Driven Development.
- [protractor](https://www.protractortest.org/) for E2E test implementation. We use `expect` syntax of [chai](http://www.chaijs.com/) assertions (`expect(...).to.equal(...)`) instead of protractor default jasmine assertions (`expect(...).toEqual(...)`)  to be consistent with unit and integration tests.
- [protractor-cucumber-framework](https://github.com/protractor-cucumber-framework/protractor-cucumber-framework) to connect Cucumber with protractor.
